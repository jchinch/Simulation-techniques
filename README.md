# Simulation-techniques
Project1 for IoT analytics
Implemented a premptive time scheduling simulation technique which will take Real Time(RT) and non Reat Time(nRT) processes. Calculated Mean and 95th percentile, and confidence intervals of Response time of RT and nRT signal by adding randomness in the process.
